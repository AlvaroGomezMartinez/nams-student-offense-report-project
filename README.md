# NORTHSIDE ALTERNATIVE MIDDLE SCHOOL<br/>NAMS Student Offense Report Project
## Northside ISD<br/>Department of Academic Technology
- Purpose of project: This project supports NAMS's student office referral workflow. Teachers fill out a Google Form when they want to create an offense report. The submission of the Google Form populates in the 2023-2024 NAMS Student Offense Report (Responses) sheet that is monitored by the NAMS administration. Administration will process the student offense report and provide information in the sheet. Administration will then indicate that they are ready to send an email to the teacher who filled out the form with the action they took and the consequences that the student received.
